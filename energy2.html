Main article: Energy transition
The chemical energy stored in the pocket battery can be converted into light . The chemical energy stored in the lead battery is also converted into electrical energy. 
Or converting the energy of sunlight into electrical energy through a photovoltaic panel .    
The amount of energy in the world is always constant, as energy does not perish or create out of nothing (the law of conservation of energy ), but it transforms from one form to another. And when it seems that the energy has been exhausted, it is in fact transformed into another form, and for this we find that energy is the ability to do work , the result of which is, for example, kinetic energy or radiant energy . 
The energy that is accompanied by movement is called kinetic energy .
 The energy that is related to position ( gravity ) is called potential energy .
 A swinging pendulum stores potential energy at its two final points (the two highest points during the pendulum movement, right and left), and at each final point of the pendulum's oscillation, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energySo it goes back in the direction of the equilibrium position (down) to the second endpoint, and so on.
Energy exists in several forms such as mechanical energy (kinetic), thermal energy , chemical energy , electrical energy , and radiant energy .
Einstein proved the equivalence of matter and energy in the theory of relativity , that is, matter can be transformed into energy, and this is what happens in the sun ( nuclear fusion ), and energy can also be transformed into matter, as in a pair production where a gamma ray turns into an electron and a positron.
