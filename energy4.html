<h3>Thomas Young , the first person to use the term "energy" in the modern sense</h3>
<br>
<p> word energy is derived from the ancient Greek: ἐνέργεια, romanized: energeia, literally. "activity, process",  which probably first appears in the works of Aristotle in the fourth century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energy was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, Gottfried Leibniz proposed the idea ( Latin : vis viva ), viva force , which is defined as the product of an object's mass and the square of its velocity; It was believed that the sum total of living strength is preserved. To account for the deceleration due to friction, Leibniz assumed that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would take more than a century for him to accept this concept in general. The modern concept of this property, kinetic energy , differs from the concept of living force only by a factor of 2 (two).

In 1807, Thomas Young may have been the first to use the term "energy" rather than "living force" in the modern sense.  Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis described " kinetic energy " in its modern sense in 1829, and in 1853 William Rankin coined the term " potential energy ". The law of conservation of energy was also first formulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system . It has been argued for several years whether heat is a physical substance, or called caloric theory , or just a physical quantity, such as momentum . In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the connection between mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, which was formulated by William Thomson ( Lord Kelvin ) as a field of thermodynamics . Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by Rudolf Clausius , Jose Gibbs , and Walter Nernst . It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and the introduction of the laws of radiant energy by Joseph Stephan . According to Noether's theorem , conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.  Thus, since 1918, theorists have recognized that the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of translational symmetryof the quantity associated with energy, i.e. time
