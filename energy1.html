<p>Energy is one of the forms of existence, as the universe is composed of bodies (bodies) and energy.  Since Einstein's theory of relativity , we know the equivalence of matter and energy , energy can be transformed into matter and vice versa, matter can be transformed into energy. We have seen the transformation of matter into energy in the invention of the atomic bomb .

    Energy can take a variety of forms, including thermal , chemical , electrical , radiological , nuclear , electromagnetic , and kinetic energy . These types of energy can be classified as kinetic energy or potential energy , while some of them can be a mixture of both potential and kinetic energies together, and this is studied in thermodynamics .
    
    All types of energy can be converted from one form to another with the help of simple tools or sometimes it requires complex techniques, for example, from chemical energy to electrical energy through the common tool batteries or accumulators , or the conversion of thermal energy into mechanical energy , and this we find in an internal combustion engine , or the conversion of solar energy into energy electric , and so on.
    
    Einstein's theory of relativity showed that matter and energy are two images of one thing, and we knew the equivalence of matter and energy . This discovery was discovered by Einstein in 1905 and he wrote it in Special Relativity . It expresses the equivalence of energy and matter in his famous equation: E=mc 2 . This discovery resulted in the invention of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 and ended World War II between Japan and the United States . We know the transformation of matter into energy by nuclear fission and nuclear fusion .
    
    Energy terminologies and transformations are very beneficial to explain the natural processes. Even weather phenomena such as wind , rain , lightning and hurricanes are the result of energy transformations that come from the sun on Earth . Life itself is one of the results of energy transformations: through photosynthesis, the sun's energy is converted into chemical energy in plants, and this stored chemical energy is later utilized in the metabolism of living organisms and humans. And from the plant produces wood , which is another source of energy due to the origin of the sun .
    
    Within social usage: the word “energy” refers to everything that falls within ene   rgy sources , energy production, consumption, and conservation of energy resources . Since all economic activities require a source of energy, its availability and prices are among the primary and key concerns. In recent years, energy consumption has emerged as one of the most important factors causing global warming , making it a major issue in all countries of the world.
