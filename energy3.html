        <p>Animal energy is considered the first work energy used by man at the dawn of civilization when he used domestic animals in his work, then he proceeded and exploited the power of the wind to run his boats to distant horizons and exploited this energy with the growth of his civilization and used it as mechanical energy in running windmills and in running the wheels of grinding machines, saws of wood and water-raising pumps From wells and others, this is what is known as mechanical energy.
